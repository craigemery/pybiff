Biff on IMAP

I have lots and lots of IMAP folders.
I have lots & lots of server-side filters, sending my incoming email to their respective fodlers.
I also have lots and lots of Archive folders too.

This tool polls the IMAP folders you have, skipping things like Archive folders, & notifies you when you have folders that have new emails.

For me, this was much easier than scanning the massive list of folders in my email app.
